How did the different social classes live?<br>Remember: In Rome, the poor lived in crowded apartment buildings. In the countryside, they lived in stone huts. Slaves lived where they worked. The wealthy had two homes - a luxurious townhouse in the city and a villa in the country. House slaves slept in the doorways of their master's bedroom."

Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 with the intention of preventing espionage on American shores.Military zones were created in California, Washington and Oregonstates with a large population of Japanese Americansand Roosevelts executive order commanded the relocation of Americans of Japanese ancestry.Executive Order 9066 affected the lives about 117,000 peoplethe majority of whom were American citizens.Canada soon followed suit, relocating 21,000 of its Japanese residents from its west coast.Inland state citizens were not keen for new Japanese residents, and they were met with racist resistance.Ten state governors voiced opposition, fearing the Japanese might never leave, and demanded they be locked up if the states were forced to accept them.A civilian organization called the War Relocation Authority was set up in March 1942 to administer the plan, with Milton S. Eisenhower, from the Department of Agriculture, to lead it.Residents that were designated as dissidents went to a special camp in Tule Lake, California.Two relocation centers in Arizona were located on Indian reservations, despite the protests of tribal councils, who were overruled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Each relocation center was its own town, featuring schools, post offices and work facilities, as well as farmland for growing food and keeping livestock, all surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers.Net factories offered work at several relocation centers.The Russo-Japanese War was also a naval conflict, with ships exchanging fire in the ...read moreThese Photos Show the Harsh Reality of Life in WWII Japanese-American Internment CampsIn February of 1942, just 10 weeks after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government issuedExecutive Order 9066, calling for the internment of Japanese-Americans., This short video shows you what it was like in a Japanese Internment camp."

3130,sin rim man realm water power king ,"In that same year Rim-Sin of Larsa, who ruled over the entire south of Babylonia, conquered Isin, which served as a buffer between Babylon and Larsa.The size, location, and military strength of the realm left to Hammurabi made it one of the major powers in Babylonia.That Hammurabi was not strong enough to change the balance of power by his own will is well expressed in a diplomatic report: ""There is no king who is powerful for himself: with Hammurabi, 'the man of Babylon,' go 10 or 15 kings, so with Rim-Sin, 'the man of Larsa'; with Ibalpiel, 'the man of Eshunna,' .This policy, begun by Hammurabi's great-grandfather but most forcefully and partially successfully pursued by his father, Hammurabi himself took up in 1787 BC, near the beginning of his reign, when he conquered the cities Uruk (Erech) and Isin, held by Rim-Sin, and clashed again with Rim-Sin the year after.That Hammurabi failed to set up an effective bureaucratic system may be attributed to his personal style in the governance of his realm and the fact that he was fully engaged in wars during the last part of his reign., Read about Hammurabi. Can you guess how Hammurabi defeated his rivals to the south?<br>Remember: Hammurabi was king of Babylon, which was located upriver in central Iraq. To defeat his southern rivals, he dammed the Euphrates River. By doing so, he could cut off the water supply, killing people in the desert, or release the water, causing a devastating flood."

4589,government senate senator way process sword save ,"With a strategy that is now crumbling beneath his feet, it is all too clear that Ted Cruz made one heck of a miscalculationone that promises to put an end to a budding political career that many believed would lead all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.And if his fellow Republicans in the Senate chose not to go along with his tactics, the Senator would, at the least, depart the town hall circuit with pockets full of publicity and legions of adoring minions who would henceforth view him as a great leader willing to fall on his own sword while appearing to bravely ignore his own political future if that is what it took to save his country from the evils of Obamacare.Because he gave you the chance to save the dogs life and it was within your power to do so, no matter how repugnant.And if, by some miracle, Cruz could use public sentiment to turn enough Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to his way of thinking, hell would freeze over before the President of the United States would go along with any continuing resolution that includes the destruction of his own, signature legislation.Cruz was placing this bet in the belief that were he to earn the credit for a government shutdown over the Obamacare issue, he would become a true hero in the hearts and minds not only of the Republican basebut the millions of independent Americans who both object to Obamacare and would not be personally affected by a shuttering of the government., In this editorial from Forbes.com, the author explores what happens when one Senator decides to break apart the normal legislative process.  Warning: this source is offering a certain opinion, but it does help readers understand what is currently going on in government.  That is, that certain members, sometimes Democrats and sometimes Republicans, might use or abuse the traditional legislative process."

1032,time weapon chemical aide president month article ,"11, 2013687See how this article appeared when it was originally published on NYTimes.com.WASHINGTON  When President Obama strode into the Rose Garden last month after a week of increasing tension over Syrias use of chemical weapons, many assumed it was to announce that the attack that had been broadly hinted at by his own aides had begun.Mr. Obamas handling of his confrontation with Syria over a chemical weapons attack on civilians has been the rare instance of a commander in chief seemingly thinking out loud and changing his mind on the fly.To aides and allies, Mr. Obamas willingness to hit the pause button twice on his decision to launch airstrikes to punish Syria for using chemical weapons on its own people reflects a refreshing open-mindedness and a reluctance to use force that they considered all too missing under his predecessor with the Texas swagger.When it came time to decide whether to send more troops to Afghanistan in 2009, he presided over three months of study and debate that even aides found excruciating at times but were presented as a more thoughtful process.Video Advertisement LIVE 00:00 2:25 Assessing Obama's Speech on Syria Channon Hodge 2:25Assessing Obama's Speech on SyriaThe Timess Michael D. Shear says that after days of anticipation, President Obamas speech on chemical weapons in Syria left out key specifics.Known as a disciplined candidate and personality, Mr. Obama earned praise for boldness with the daring Special Forces operation in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, although that obscured the months of secret deliberations the public did not see.He set a red line against the use of chemical weapons without defining what it would entail.Once a sarin gas attack on Aug. 21 killed more than 1,400 civilians, according to American intelligence, Mr. Obama agreed that a military response was needed while making clear how much he wished it were not.I would much rather spend my time talking about how to make sure every 3- and 4-year-old gets a good education than I would spending time thinking about how can I prevent 3- and 4-year-olds from being subjected to chemical weapons and nerve gas, he lamented during a visit to Sweden last week.Id rather always have a president who will make the right decisions at the right time, said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, than a president who makes the wrong decisions because he doesnt want to give more time.Correction:Sept. 13, 2013Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with the continuation of an article about President Obamas recent pivots in his policy toward Syria over a chemical weapons attack on civilians misstated, in some editions, the day on which Syrian government troops were shown in the strategically important town of Maalula after they had beaten back Islamist rebels., The Times covers Obama on Syria, and takes a look at how and why his position continues to evolve and shift. Review this article to see the real world applications of these concepts."

As you have learned, the sun is composed mostly of helium and hydrogen.  It also has layers, each increasing in temperature and pressure nearing the center.  Starting in the center and working your way out, you will find the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone, followed by the photosphere.  Use this text to learn about the features of each layer."
