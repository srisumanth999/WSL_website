Bush in his deep reluctance to use American power in long, drawn-out conflicts where national interests were remote and allies were missing.AdvertisementAt the United Nations on Tuesday, Mr. Obama drove home the conclusion that he came to after his own party deserted him over a military response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,000 Syrians: The bigger risk for the world in coming years is not that the United States will try to build empires abroad, he argued, but that there will be a price to be paid in chaos and disorder if Americans elect to stay home.Now, after a remarkable month that began with his planning and then aborting a Tomahawk missile strike against the military facilities of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Obama has recommitted himself, he told world leaders on Tuesday, to devoting the rest of his presidency to two high-risk diplomatic initiatives: finding a negotiated end to the Iran confrontation, and creating a separate state for the Palestinians that Israel can live with, without fear.Success in a region that has stymied two Bushes and two Clintons would become the legacy issue of his presidency  but three years and four months is not a long time to resolve disputes that date back decades.It was a measure of how complicated those efforts are that Irans president, Hassan Rouhani, shied away Tuesday not only from a handshake but also from any substantive discussion of resolving its disputes with a country it has long denounced as the Great Satan.AdvertisementConspicuously missing from those two top priorities was a strategy for a lasting solution in Syria, apart from assuring the world that, by negotiation or force, its chemical stockpiles would not be released again and the country would not become a safe haven for terrorist groups.President Obama at a luncheon on Tuesday hosted by the secretary general of the United Nations.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesImagePresident Obama at a luncheon on Tuesday hosted by the secretary general of the United Nations.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesWhat makes the task all the harder for Mr. Obama is a sense that American power in the region is diminished  partly because United States forces have left Iraq; partly because Mr. Obamas own team has been deeply divided on when to intervene; and partly because Mr. Obamas own declaration of the pivot to Asia has been interpreted, rightly or wrongly, as evidence he has given up on the Middle East.One could hear echoes of that frustration in his speech to the General Assembly, when Mr. Obama came to the edge of mocking those who accuse America of intervening to seek resources or influence across the globe.Get The New York Times for just $1 a week.You have 1 free article remaining.SubscribeCollapseExpandcampaign: Nons|INYT|August2017BAU|IndiaGeo|2018LPBeautification|VI|2018-11-13-ongoing -- 11793645767, creative: Dock Multilink, source: optimizely, creator: DH Subscribe to debate, not division., This article from the NYTIMES examines how Obama has shifted on foreign policy over time, and explains why that is.
